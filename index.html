    WORK EXPERIENCE
    Tata Consultancy Services									      Thane, Maharashtra
    Data Scientist									                	           September2021-Current
    Working on building machine learning models which can correctly predict the estimated time of arrival of parts ordered by dealers or customers for our Automobile Industry client.
    Improving ETA results as compared to legacy code by increasing predictions of on time delivery results days. Building result matrices  to display percentage of ETA calculated as early and delayed by 1 to 10 days.
    Building Pipeline code to deploy our model in production so that it can generate results in real time. Visualized results and provided insights to the customers.
    Working on moving on-premise pipeline to AWS and migration of data from greenplum data lake to snowflake.
    Wafer fault detection project to identify defected wafers using sensor data. Developed clustering model to cluster dataset and build individual model for each cluster to get most optimum classification results. 
    POC to automate manual classification of tickets generated by clients and classifying them into multiple categories based on the description provided in the particular ticket or incident.
    Software Developer								               September 2020 - August 2021
    Developed web applications for automobile Industry clients. One Dealer facing and one for DSP. Developed Each application with 2 views, admin access and general access.
    Designed  the entire database schema and project architecture from scratch by understanding the business and its requirements.
    Worked on dynamic report generation for clients to understand all the actions performed by dealers and DSPs.

    Projects
    Estimate Time of Arrival Prediction for automotive parts.
    Developed ML based solution to predict ETA for a given order placed by dealers to an automobile company.
    Created SQL pipeline to store a large amount of data into a data lake from multiple parent tables. 
    Exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to get top features from a large dataset.
    Worked on model training and optimization and selected the best model for the dataset
    Built a PowerBI dashboard to visualize data and results to provide insight to customers.
    
    Image Captioning using CNNs and RNNs 
    Developed a Deep learning approach to generate automatic captions for given images.
    Built a CNN model to understand the given image features and RNN model for generating captions.
    Prepared data by cleaning and preprocessing captions and built LSTM based architecture  to generate captions.
    Worked on generating result matrices and visualization and achieved a Bleu score of 0.56 for our model.
    Wafer Fault Detection
    Developed classifier to identify if the given Wafer is defected or not based on sensor readings.
    Worked on data validation, transformation and saved preprocessed data into a database. 
    Creating multiple clusters out of data and trained models for each cluster. 
    Saved model and created a pipeline code for result generation. 
    Helmet Detection 
    Object detection system to identify riders without helmets in a given video feed using YOLO5 model and flask.
    Trained our model on a custom annotated dataset using label Img to detect vehicles and helmets. 
    The mode achieved a successful mAP of 65 and saved the detection results and license plate details in the database.
